            <p> This is <b>Grey Towers</b> in Milford Pa. Grey Towers was the home of Gifford Pinchot, founder and first Chief of the US Forest Service and is now a popular family attraction. 
                They have tours where you can see all the hidden rooms, and there's even a table made of water where you float the food around on baskets. 
                this was one of my favorite places of Milford so i felt like it should be here.</p>

            <p>This is <b>Gold Key Lake</b>, I grew up near here and would always bike to the lake to go hang out with my friends. 
                That building is a hotel, recreational area, and restaurant all in one. 
                They always had good pizza and you could order from outside, so instead of going outside you can eat on the deck.</p>

        <section id="joap">
            <p>If you're hungry, John of Arthur's Avenue was my favorite restaurant to eat at in Milford. 
                It was a pizza place and the guy that owned it was friends with my parents so we would get tours of the place. 
                We would always go after swim practice or if we were just hungry. 
                There were other and more quality restaurants nearby but this place was always nice to be at.</p>
